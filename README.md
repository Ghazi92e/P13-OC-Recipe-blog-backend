## Final project: ready for the fireworks ?

The project you will work on must have a social impact and be of high added value for the community at large. That's how we are at OpenClassrooms: we share!

Carry out a digital project in the form that seems most appropriate to you (make a web application; code a website or a mobile application...) to meet a need around you. It can be a booking site for the theater association of your city, an application to locate and reference found objects during a festival, etc.

For this final project, I decided to create a social network web application where each user can add one or more recipes to share with his subscribers
